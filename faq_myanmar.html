</ul>
<p class="q"><a href="1"></a>How is the Myanmar language encoded?</p>
<p class="a">A: The Myanmar script was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burmese_alphabet#Unicode">added to the Unicode Standard in Version 3.0</a> (September, 199) and was significantly extended in Version 5.2 (2009). Unicode now has three blocks for characters of this script:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1000.pdf">The base Myanmar characters</a> (Range: 1000-109F),</li>
<li><a href="http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/UAA60.pdf">Myanmar Extended-A</a> (Range: AA60–AA7F),</li>
<li><a href="http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/UA9E0.pdf">Myanmar Extended-B</a> (Range: A9E0–A9FF).</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p class="a">
Code points include letters (consonants and independent vowels), vowel
signs, medial signs, digits, various signs, and punctuation. Medial
and vowel signs, anusvara, visarga, virama, asat and others combine
with letters. Unicode defines the order of combining characters for
correct display.
</p>
<p class="a">
These code points support several languages written in the script,
including Myanmar (Burmese), Pali, Sanskrit, Shan, Mon, Karen, Kayah,
and others.
</p>

<p class="q"><a href="2"></a>What other encodings are commonly used ?
</p>
<p class="a">
A: Several other encodings are in common use, all based on different arrangements of characters and combining marks. These include ZawgyiOne, Zawgyi 2000, Myazedi, and others.
</p>

<p class="q"><a href="3"></a>What are the differences between these encodings?
</p>
<p class="a">
A: Although other encodings may use the same code point range as the base Unicode block (U_1000 - U+109F), they are not compatible with Unicode. Some characters are common in these fonts, especially the base consonants, but other characters and combining marks differ widely.
Of course, the shapes shown for given code points depend on the specific font that is used.
</p>
<p class="a">
<a href="http://my.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Font">Wikipedia:Font</a> shows the code point differences for both Unicode and Zawgyi, which is the most commonly used non-Unicode scheme.
</p>
<p class="a">
For each combining character, Unicode defines a single code point such
as U+103c, which is the <em>ra medial</em> that surrounds a consonant
with a line. A Unicode font combines this with other code points to
create the right shape.
</p>
<p class="a">
Unicode also defines a unique order of code points for base letters adn combining characters.
<p class="a">
Non-unicode fonts use as many as 8 code points for different parts of the <em>ra</em> glyph for narrow and wide consonants and other conditions. The user needs to type the right one for each context. This also means more code points are needed for the Burmese language than in the Unicode. These fonts also allow multiple orderings of combining marks and base letters, without a unique representation of each combination.
<p class="a">
An incorrect match between font and text shows "dotted" characters or overlapping lines, and also and incorrect characters, as shown in the following table.
<p class="a">
<table class="subtle">
<tr>
<th >Encoding</th>
<th>With ZawgyiOne font</th>
<th>With Unicode (Padauk) font</th>
<th>Code points</th>
</tr>

</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p class="a">
To be understood correctly, text must be shown in the same font as written, or the text must be converted to the font used for display.
</p>

<p class="q"><a href="3.01"></a>Can we use a <em>universal font</em> that will display Unicode and Zawgyi text together?
</p>
<p class="a">
A: No. Since the code points of different characters are in the same
range (0x1000-0x109f), no font can automatically apply the right character shapes. No <em>universal font</em> is possible.</li>
</p>
<p class="a">
However, HTML may use different fonts explicitly in tagged regions if the encoding of the text inside has been detected.
</p>

<p class="q"><a href="3.02"></a>Doesn't "UTF-8" indicate Unicode?
</p>
<p class="a">
A: No. UTF-8 is a scheme for representing a code point in 1, 2, 3, or 4 bytes. Since the code points all use the same range, UTF-8 can be used to represent any of these encodings.
</>

<p class="q"><a href="3.1"></a>What are some advantages and disadvantages of different encodings?
</p>
<p class="a">
A: Here are the main Unicode points:
<ul>
<li>+ It is the standard accepted by the World Wide Web Consortium, and works on almost every device and operating now available.</li>
<li>+ Search is seamless with Unicode, since there is only one way to define a character.</li>
<li>+ Unicode fonts support more than 12 languages written in
Myanmar script, not only Burmese.
<li>+ Each combining mark is a single character, making input easier.
<li>+ Multiple Unicode-compatible fonts are available, allowing users to choose different "look and feel", similar to other scripts such as Latin.
<li>- The font rendering is more complex, requiring a modern rendering engine.</li>
<li>- Code points must be in a defined order for combining marks to be shown.</li>
<li>- Many websites, documents, and systems have been implemented with
other encoding schemes.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p class="a">
The following notes apply to ZawgyiOne, Zawgwyi 2008, Myazedi and others:
<ul>
<li>+ Widely used for existing web sites, documents, and user communictions.</li>
<li>+ A simpler rendering engine can implement the graphical output.</li>
<li>- Many more code points are used, so only the Burmese language can
be written with these fonts. Characters for other languages using this script are missing.</li>
<li>- In most cases, only a single font has been defined for each encoding, limiting styles of text that can be displayed.</li>
<li>- The order of code points is flexible, making searching and
matching text difficult. For example, search engines results are
highly dependent the specific order in which text has been typed.
</li>
</ul>
</p>


<p class="q"><a href="4"></a>How can I tell what encoding is used for a particular website or piece of text?
</p>
<p class="a">
A: Almost all text in a given encoding will render correctly only when displayed with a compatible font. For example, Zawgyi text will appear incorrect with a Unicode font, and text encoding as Unicode will look wrong with ZawgyiOne font. However, since a subset of characters is common to all these fonts, some strings will be identical in all encodings.
</p>
<p class="a">Some online tools are available that will help determine the encoding of text.
<ul>
<li><a href="http://zawgyi-unicode-test.appspot.com/">zawgyi-unicode-test.appspot.com</a> takes text and displays it using several common fonts, including two diiferet Unicode fonts.
</li>
<li>Several web sites offer detectors that use Javascript to look for non-Unicode patterns. <strong>TODO: Give some examples and links.
</strong>
</ul>
</p>

<p class="q"><a href="4.1"></a>So isn't Unicode just another font for Myanmar?
</p>
<p class="a">
A: Yes and no. Unicode for Myanmar is more than a font. It defines
character code points and also requires a specific ordering of code
points for consistent text rendering. Unicode-compliant fonts
already expect this ordering to display characters correctly.
</p>
<p class="a">
As a published standard, Unicode provides a public description of each
code point, plus characterstics that can be used for other text
processing functions such as its collation, combining status, and
combining order. These are available via
the <a href="http://site.icu-project.org/">ICU C++ and Java
libraries</a>.
</p>


<p class="q"><a href="5"></a>Are there special Unicode fonts for Myanmar text? Where can I find them?
</p>
<p class="a">
A: Many Unicode-compatible fonts have appear for displaying Mynamar text. These include:
<ul>
<li>
TBD:
</li>
</ul>
Important: proper display of characters depends both on the font and on the rendering software (<em>engine</em>) used.
</p>

<p class="q"><a href="6"></a>What languages can be written with Unicode Myanmar characters?
</p>
<p class="a">
A: Characters for these languages are supported in the 3 Unicode
Myanmar blocks noted above:
<ul>
<li>Myanmar (Burmese)</li>
<li>Mon</li>
<li>S'gaw Karen</li>
<li>Western Pwo Karen</li>
<li>Eastern Pwo Karen</li>
<li>Geba Karen</li>
<li>Kaya</li>
<li>Shan</li>
<li>Rumai Palaung</li>
<li>Khamti Shan</li>
<li>Aiton</li>
<li>Phake</li>
<li>Pa'o Karen</li>
<li>Shwe Palaung </li>
<li>Shan Pali</li>
<li>Tai Laing</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p class="q"><a href="7"></a>Is it possible to convert text in other encodings to Unicode?
</p>
<p class="a">
A: Yes. Several converters are publicly available in programming languages including JavaScript, Java, and C++.
<ul>
<li>
TBD: start this list.
</li>
</ul>

</p>

<p class="q"><a href="8"></a>Should I support both Unicode and Zawgyi on my site? If so, how do I do that?
</p>
<p class="a">
A: Since may platforms do not yet have Unicode fonts, it is very helpful to provide a way for any user to view content. Several techniques are described here:
<ul>
<li><strong>Use a webfont</strong> on your site and apply it with CSS
in any HTML block that displays text, e.g., a <em>&lt;div
class="myfontclass"&gt;</em> tag. The font is loaded along with the
text, allowing modern browsers to display text in the loaded
font. This works well in most cases for either Zawgyi or Unicode
text. However, transmitting the font increases load time for such
content.
<li>
<li>
<strong>Let users switch</strong> via a prominent control on the page
to select either Unicode or other encoding. Then use this setting to
load load the correct pages. An automatic converter may be used to
prepare text as needed. This has the advantage of no font download,
but adds complexity on both the client and server.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Detect the encoding of user-entered text</strong>. Use this to provide text in the detected encoding.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Don't worry about it.</strong> Provide content in only Zawgyi
or Unicode and let users determine to use your site based on the
encoding. This limits the visibility of your content, of course.
</li>
</ul>
Important: Remember that search engines may not understand all text
encodings. Unicode text on your site can be consistently interpreted.
</p>

<p class="q"><a href="9"></a>My site has content entered by users in both Zawgyi and Unicode text. How can my users read both?
</p>
<p class="a">
A: Good for you to care that your users can read all messages! There are at least two ways to handle this, similar to the methods described for web sites. Each requires detecting the encoding of each message posted.
<ul>
  <li>
    Use webfonts for the site. Make sure each  posting is in its own tagged block such as <em>div</em>. Set the CSS for each posting to a font based on the encoding.
  </li>
  <li>
    Convert all postings to Unicode form. Set CSS to use Unicode-compatible fonts.
  </li>
</ul>
You may consider educating your users on using Unicode fonts.
</p>

<p class="q"><a href="9.1"></a>How is Myanmar handled on mobile devices?
</p>
<p class="a">
A: Most mobile devices do not allow the user to change or replace the installed fonts. An application may "bundle" a font, but that will only be used within the application, not for other tools or apps.
</p>
<p class="a">
Many devices already include a Unicode compliant font that is used by default for any Myanmar text. Any Unicode text will be appear correctly in the system-installed applications.
Zawgyi text will be shown incorrectly unless the particular application has included the Zawgyi font within the application.
</p>
<p class="a">
Some phone vendors have installed ZawgyiOne in place of a Unicode font. In this case, Zawgyi will look right, but Unicode text in messages and web sites will look wrong.
</p>
<p class="a">
It is possible for an application to detect and convert text between encodings to match the installed fonts. However, this is not common.
</p>

<p class="q"><a href="9.2"></a>How can I tell if my system is using a Unicode font or Zawgyi by default?
<p class="a">
  Just examine the appearance of the Myanmar character code point (U+104e):
  <font size="18"> ၎
  </font>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>If the character looks like this, it is using a Unicode font:</td>
    <td><img src="myanmar-images/U104eUnicodeFont.png"></td>
    <td>If it looks like this, your browser is using Zawgyi or Myazedi:</td>
    <td><img src="myanmar-images/U104eZawgyiFont.png"></td>
  </tr>
<table>
</p>

</p>
<p class="q"><a href="10"></a>My friends all use Zawgyi in email and texting, but my device only supports Unicode. How can I communicate with them?
</p>
<p class="a">
A: This is more complicated because fonts cannot be added or changed on
most mobile devices. Free Myanmar Unicode keyboards are available for
most mobile devices from online sources, so work with your friends to
agree on a common way to communicate.
</p>
<p class="a">
Apps that convert between Zawgyi and Unicode are also available. Copying and pasting text messages into such an interactive converter will let you read any message.
</p>

<!-- Craig to stop here -->

<p class="q"><a href="11"></a>Do I need an IME to properly enter Myanmar text?
</p>
<p class="a">
</p>

<p class="q"><a href="12"></a>Is the keyboard arrangement for Unicode different from other fonts?
</p>
<p class="a">
  <!-- srl --> Unicode does not specify a keyboard arrangement, but leaves the keyboard or IME provider free to arrange the keyboard
  in the most natural way for the users. 
</p>

<p class="q"><a href="13"></a>Where do I find the Unicode characters for Myanmar script?
</p>
<p class="a">
  <!-- srl --> 
  The Myanmar script is documented in <a href="http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode7.0.0/ch16.pdf">Chapter 16</a> of
    The Unicode Standard version 7.0.  
  <a href='http://unicode.org/cldr/utility/list-unicodeset.jsp?a=[%3AMymr%3A]&g='>This link</a> will show all Myanmar script characters.
    
</p>

<p class="q"><a href="16"></a>What about collation of Myanmar language data? Is that
just a binary sort?
</p>
<p class="a">
<!-- srl -->  Generally, a binary sort is not recommended, instead use the <a href="">Unicode Collation Algorithm</a>. 
  The collation chart for Myanmar is <a href="http://unicode.org/charts/collation/chart_Myanmar.html">here</a>.
</p>

<p class="q"><a href="17"></a>I cannot find the code points for the kinzi in Unicode. What do I do?
</p>
<p class="a">
A <em>kinzi</em> is where the first consonant in a cluster is a non-word-final letter NGA. In this case, NGA rises over the following letter, <a href="http://rishida.net/scripts/myanmar/">as described here.</a> This combination appears as a small character similar to a Greek epsilon over the following letter.
<p class="a">
ZawgyiOne represents <em>kinzi</em> with a single code point 0x1064 for this combination <em>kinzi</em></p>.
<p class="a">
In Unicode, NGA + ASAT is entered, followed by a VIRAMA to position
the character over the next letter.  This allows searching for the NGA
letter as a character. The <em>kinzi</em> sequence is code points
U+1004 U+103A U+1039, followed by the next letter.
</p>
<p class="q"><a href="21"></a>Unicode doesn't have characters for subscripted vowels. How can I enter them?
</p>
<p class="a">
</p>

<p class="q"><a href="22"></a>I want to know how to put a virama in my text. How is this done?
</p>
<p class="a">
</p>

<p class="q"><a href="23"></a>I want to read content that includes both Unicode and Zawgyi text. Can I do this?
</p>
<p class="a">
</p>

<p class="q"><a href="23.1"></a>I am using a Unicode-compliant font on Unicode text. However, some characters are rendered incorrectly. What is wrong?
</p>
<p class="a">
</p>

<p class="q"><a href="23.2"></a>Will everyone eventually convert to Unicode?
